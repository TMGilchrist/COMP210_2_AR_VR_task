# COMP210_2_AR VR Task

## Pin-art Terrain Sculptor


### Core mechanics:
The concept for this project is inspired by the Pinscreen toy (a metal grid of pins that can be pushed out to create images). The player will be able to sculpt a surface of pins into interesting shapes by raising and lower areas of the surface with hands, simulating magnetism. A key feature of the project will be creating a natural looking distribution of pin heights when an area is raised or lowered, to create a more natural looking effect.

* Surface grid of pins that can move individually. (hexagonal?)
* Ability to raise areas of the pins. (simulate magnetic force to create a spread of pin heights - see reference images)
* Ability to lowr areas of the pins.
* Ability to freeze the pins in position. (maybe this is the default)
* Ability to reset the surface


### VR Platform
The HTC Vive has over 35% revenue market share (as of Q1 2018) and is the lead VR platform in China. This shows there is a large audience of Vive users who would be able to play the game. In addition to this, it is supported by Unity, SteamVR and Leap Motion - all technologies I will be looking to use in this project.

### Controller
Although a basic version of the project could simply use the Vive controllers in place of the user's hands, implementing hand tracking using the Leap Motion device would add an extra level of immersion by allowing the player to interact more naturally with the game. Handtracking would also allow for more nuance in the mechanics of the game, as the player could raise small areas with a pinch or large areas with a flattened palm.


### Game Potential

This mechanic could be integrated into a turn based strategy game as a terrain-altering mechanic. The player would be able to raise or lower a number of pins on the terrain grid, which could block or free unit movement across the board.
