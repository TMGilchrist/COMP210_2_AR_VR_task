# COMP210_2_AR VR Task

## Pin-art Terrain Sculptor


### Core mechanics:
Surface made up of many small pins. The player can draw them up and freeze them into position to create interesting landscapes and sculptures.

* Surface grid of pins that can move individually (hexagonal?)
* Ability to raise areas of the pins (simulate magnetic force to create a spread of pin heights - see reference images)
* Ability to freeze the pins in position (maybe this is the default)
* Ability to release pins (maybe all of them for simplicity) to reset the surface
